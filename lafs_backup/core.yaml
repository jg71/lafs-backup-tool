### Default (baseline) configuration parameters.
### DO NOT ever change this config, use -c commandline option instead!


source:
  # Path or glob pattern (to match path) to backup, required
  path: # example: /srv/backups/weekly.*

  queue:
    # Path to intermediate backup queue-file (list of paths to upload), required
    path: # example: /srv/backups/queue.txt
    # Don't rebuild queue-file if it's newer than source.path

    # Path to persistent db of remote directory nodes, required
    path: # example: /srv/backups/dentries.db
    delete_batch: 10000 # buffer key deletes, 0 or false for no limit

  # How to pick a path among those matched by "path" glob
  pick_policy: alphasort_last # only one supported

        #  Unlike "filter", first element of rule-tuple can also be a number,
        #   overriding "min_size" parameter for matched (by that rule) paths.
        # If none of the patterns match path, file is handled as if it was matched by '+' rule.

filter:
  # Either tuples like "[action ('+' or '-'), regexp]" or just exclude-patterns (python
  #  regexps) to match relative (to source.path, starting with "/") paths to backup.
  # Patterns are matched against each path in order they're listed here.
  # Leaf directories are matched with the trailing slash
  #  (as with rsync) to be distinguishable from files with the same name.
  # If path doesn't match any regexp on the list, it will be included.
  #
  # Examples:
  #  - ['+', '/\.git/config$']   # backup git repository config files
  #  - '/\.git/'   # *don't* backup any repository objects
  #  - ['-', '/\.git/']   # exactly same thing as above (redundant)

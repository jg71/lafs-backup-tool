filter:
  # Either tuples like "[action ('+' or '-'), regexp]" or just exclude-patterns (python
  #  regexps) to match relative (to source.path, starting with "/") paths to backup.
  # Patterns are matched against each path in order they're listed here.
  # Leaf directories are matched with the trailing slash
  #  (as with rsync) to be distinguishable from files with the same name.
  # If path doesn't match any regexp on the list, it will be included.
  #
  # Examples:
  #  - ['+', '/\.git/config$']   # backup git repository config files
  #  - '/\.git/'   # *don't* backup any repository objects
  #  - ['-', '/\.git/']   # exactly same thing as above (redundant)
  #  - '/(?i)\.?svn(/.*|ignore)$' # exclude (case-insensitive) svn (or .svn) paths and ignore-lists

  # - '/(CVS|RCS|SCCS|_darcs|\{arch\})/$'
  # - '/\.(git|hg|bzr|svn|cvs)(/|ignore|attributes|tags)?$'
  # - '/=(RELEASE-ID|meta-update|update)$'
